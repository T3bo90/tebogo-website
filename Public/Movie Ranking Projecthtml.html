<h1>The Best Movies Tebogo Khiba Ever Watched</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies fo All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>I really like how the directior played with my mind, because at the end, I still don't know if Learnardo, the main character, when he was spinning that thing, was he doing it from a dream or reality. Moreover, I also fell in love with Hans Zimmer because of the tracklist</p>

<h3>Bat Man | The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>I think you know why this is here, and also Hans Zimmer on the tracklist</p>

<h3>Apocalypto</h3>
<p>I really like this movie because it teaches us about ancient civilisations and how evil just people are, insalaving and even murdering people just for selfish and prejudice backgrounds</p>
