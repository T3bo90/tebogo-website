<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a graphic designer that and I love my job. I like creating impactful designs 
  that leave an impression and serve their purpose. I am very passionate about upskilling and 
  learning new ways on how to solve problems creatively, visually and effectively. </p>

<p>Taking up this course, to learn how to develop websites from scratch has long been my desire from university. I always wanted
  to be versatile and be a proactive and an effective problem solver. Creativity goes so far but, one can hit a wall if they
  can't put their creativity down, due to lack of skills to use their tools or to solve the problem.
</p>

<p>I am a firm believer in that we all have what it takes to become great. It takes dedication and hardwork to get there. Taking up this
  class, not only is it a previlege but an honour. I am very grateful for the opportunities that we are provided with. I thank everyone at Appbrewery who put
  this together and a special thank you to Angela for taking the time to walk us through this, really, really appreciate it.
